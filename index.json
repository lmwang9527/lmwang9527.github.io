These new trip generation models often adopt sophisticated non-linear model forms to utilize new information and incorporate new factors influencing trip generation. However, if sufficient caution is not taken in their application, these new trip generation models may generate severe biases. Two typical sources of biases in the applications of such models are aggregation bias and detransformation bias. The former arises when aggregate variables are included in an individual-level model or when naive aggregation of independent variables are conducted in prediction from a non-linear model, and the latter when de-transforming a non-linearly transformed dependent variable in the prediction process (e.g. predicting from a semi-log model). While these two types of biases are well known and corrections routinely suggested in other disciplines (Wooldridge, 2012, pp212-215) or even in other models of travel demand (Ortuzar and Willumsen, 2011), they have not been adopted in the new trip generation models. In this paper, we describe and demonstrate these two sources of biases with numeric simulations and empirical analyses, before discuss their implications and remedies in applications in the context of modeling trip generation.","tags":null,"title":"De-Transformation Bias in Non-linear Trip Generation Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R","Reproducible Research"],"content":" R Markdown I have switched to solely use R Markdown for the communication step of my tidy work flow and found it pleasant and actually prodocutive to use. However, there is one major hassle: output in Word format. In a perfect world, I would never need to use any Microsoft products ever again. In reality when I need to work with collaborators that do not use RMarkdown and funders of research projects that require reports in Word format (and a required style template), there are no other options. As a matter of fact, it seems that the only viable solution collaborating with anybody that doesn\u0026rsquo;t use RMarkdown and/or git is still MS Word as of 2017\u0026frasl;10.\nRendering R Markdown file to word_document works for the most part, except for sophisticated tables, which, unfortunately, are prevalent in most of my work.\nPossible Solutions There are a few possible solutions, none of them good enough for me at this point:\n Gmisc::docx_document (the output is a html file with an additional css file; no support for Word style template); Convert html output to Word document through soffice (Tables in the output do not resemble the html input; some support for template); Pure R solution officer + flextable (They can generate good looking Word output, but they do not work with R Markdown yet (see below)).  My solution/hack (as of 2017\u0026frasl;10)  Render Rmd file with output set to rmarkdown::word_document; The Rmd file uses texreg/htmlreg to generate html tables for regression results and saves them into separate html files (one for each table) during rendering; Convert html to docx: a. Via Word COM through py32win module (the used option) b. Via docx-html-js c. Via soffice: soffice --headless --convert-to docx:\u0026quot;MS Word 2007 XML\u0026quot; --writer --outdir . Table\\ 1.html Patch the rendered word_document and replace placeholder tables with actual tables  Steps and Files:  rmarkdown::render(\u0026quot;reg_tables_demo.Rmd\u0026quot;) python html2docx.py tabs/ (requiring py32win and Microsoft Word on a Windows PC, tested with MS Office 2016 and python 2.7) source(\u0026quot;patch_docx_tables.R\u0026quot;); patchFlexTables(\u0026quot;reg_tables_demo.docx\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tabs/\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;reg_tables_demo_final.docx\u0026quot;) Final reg_tables_demo.docx  All files/scripts used can be founded on github: https://github.com/cities-lab/rmd-docx\nAlternatives / Things to keep an eye on  broom \u0026gt; huxtable \u0026gt; flextable \u0026gt; pandoc (2.0)\nThis solution directly knitr::knit Rmd files into Word documents embedding flextables through xml chunks. It eliminates the need to run scripts outside knit and is a much more elegant solution than my solution above. However it is not yet an acceptable solution at the moment for a number of reasons:\ni. pandoc 2.0 is not yet released. Users will need to build their own pandoc installation from source. i. The flextable implementation, standing as a proposal by Maxim Nazarov, is yet to be incorporated in flextable\u0026rsquo;s code base, although Maxim\u0026rsquo;s code should work already. i. broom supports a small set of model objects than texreg, although broom + huxtable seem to be a better solution in the long run given they follow the tidy philosophy and broom is now part of tidyverse.\n pandoc, when it improves its support for sophisticated tables in unknown future\nThe table support currently in pandoc is rudimentary, in particular, no support for table row/column spans, which is what sent me down this rabbit hole. Once the issue is resolved, it\u0026rsquo;d be as easy and functional to produce Word outputs as html and pdf ones. Not sure when this would be resolved (if ever), as the github issue has been open for 4 years now.\n  Credits  Carsten Behring for coming out with the idea and sharing his code for the Word patching hack; Max Gordon   ","date":1508630400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508630400,"objectID":"9e303d13f7ccb527aef8ca1390623200","permalink":"/post/2017-10-22-creating-tables/","publishdate":"2017-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-10-22-creating-tables/","section":"post","summary":"R Markdown I have switched to solely use R Markdown for the communication step of my tidy work flow and found it pleasant and actually prodocutive to use.

In this paper, I first define and introduce the two approaches to data analysis (what), and explain why/where both approaches have their appeal. I then demonstrate when and how each approach has its strength and weakness through two case studies with real data. In the first case study, I show that imputing missing data for the National Household Travel Survey with machine learning techniques enables more robust regression analysis while capturing the uncertainties introduced in the imputation process. In the second case study, again with the NHTS data, I show how machine learning algorithms facilitate variable selection and consideration of non-linear and interaction effects, which can help inform estimations of regression models, and when machine learning techniques can replace or complement statistical models. Through a review of the development of machine learning methods and their applications in social science and two case studies with actual data commonly used in transportation research, I hope to show the value of machine learning to planning researchers.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical Models vs Machine Learning: A Reflection with Two Case Studies","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Lingqian Hu","Liming Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504051200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504051200,"objectID":"de4db98774361e5a587fc5fb51f934dd","permalink":"/publication/housing-location-choices-of-the-poor/","publishdate":"2017-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/housing-location-choices-of-the-poor/","section":"publication","summary":"This research investigates whether access to jobs affects poor households’ residential location choices using data from individual households in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. Our results, based on discrete choice models, show that the effects of job accessibility on household location choices are contingent upon households’ automobile ownership and employment status. Places with higher job accessibility by public transit mode are more likely to attract poor households that do not own cars but have at least one employed worker or one labour force participant, while job accessibility by automobile travel mode has no positive effect on the location choices of poor households who own automobiles. The results stress the importance of job accessibility for those poor households with limited transportation mobility but strong needs for access to jobs.","tags":null,"title":"Housing location choices of the poor: does access to jobs matter?","type":"publication"}]
